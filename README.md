# OTT Boilerplate

### Until I decide on a better name

Small project that I took on in my free time to rebuild most of the customer/watch pages seen on sites like mhzchoice.vhx.tv or yogawithadriene.vhx.tv. This uses the VHX/Vimeo OTT API for all requests. It does not have everything in place (in particular authentication and pagination). See here for a roadmap of things to do if this were to be mostly re-usable: https://github.com/davegonzalez/ott-boilerplate/projects/1

## Why?

- I wanted to get some experience with SSR using Next.js
- I wanted to get some experience building themes and toggling between them using Styled Components (still a TODO)
- If this were to work out, it could be a starting point for any OTT seller to build their own site and then modify as needed
